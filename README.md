Cryptocurrency Clustering Project
Overview
This project focuses on the analysis and clustering of cryptocurrencies based on their price changes over different time frames. By applying unsupervised learning techniques, particularly K-means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), we aim to group similar cryptocurrencies and draw insights from their market behaviors.

Objectives
Data Exploration: Load and explore the cryptocurrency market data to understand its structure and trends.
Data Preparation: Normalize the data using StandardScaler to make it suitable for clustering.
K-means Clustering: Implement K-means clustering to group cryptocurrencies based on their price change patterns.
Optimization with PCA: Reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using PCA and explore the impact on clustering.
Cluster Analysis: Analyze and interpret the characteristics of each cluster.
Visualization: Create various plots, including scatter plots and elbow plots, to visualize the clustering results and the optimal number of clusters.
Key Accomplishments
Data Normalization: Successfully scaled the dataset using StandardScaler to prepare for clustering.
Elbow Method Analysis: Determined the optimal number of clusters for K-means clustering by utilizing the Elbow Method.
Clustering with K-means: Applied K-means clustering to group cryptocurrencies, first using the original scaled data and then with PCA-reduced data.
PCA for Dimensionality Reduction: Implemented PCA to reduce the dataset to three principal components, capturing the essence of the dataset with reduced dimensionality.
Cluster Interpretation: Analyzed the formed clusters to understand the grouping of cryptocurrencies based on their price change behavior.
Visualizations: Created insightful visualizations including scatter plots colored by cluster labels and elbow plots for both the original and PCA-reduced data.
